## Marlin 2.1 Bugfix Branch

__Not for production use. Use with caution!__

Marlin 2.1 takes this popular RepRap firmware to the next level by adding support for much faster 32-bit and ARM-based boards while improving support for 8-bit AVR boards. Read about Marlin's decision to use a "Hardware Abstraction Layer" below.

This branch is for patches to the latest 2.1.x release version. Periodically this branch will form the basis for the next minor 2.1.x release.

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Example Configurations

Before building Marlin you'll need to configure it for your specific hardware. Your vendor should have already provided source code with configurations for the installed firmware, but if you ever decide to upgrade you'll need updated configuration files. Marlin users have contributed dozens of tested example configurations to get you started. Visit the [MarlinFirmware/Configurations](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations) repository to find the right configuration for your hardware.

## Building Marlin 2.1

To build Marlin 2.1 you'll need [Arduino IDE 1.8.8 or newer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or [PlatformIO](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide). We've posted detailed instructions on [Building Marlin with Arduino](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html) and [Building Marlin with PlatformIO for ReArm](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_rearm.html) (which applies well to other 32-bit boards).

## Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

Marlin 2.0 introduced a layer of abstraction to allow all the existing high-level code to be built for 32-bit platforms while still retaining full 8-bit AVR compatibility. Retaining AVR compatibility and a single code-base is important to us, because we want to make sure that features and patches get as much testing and attention as possible, and that all platforms always benefit from the latest improvements.
